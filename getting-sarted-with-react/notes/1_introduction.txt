> React is a JS Library for building User Interfaces.
> React is declarative.
  - HTML: Declarative for static content.
  - React: Declarative for dynamic data.

Why React?
- The "Virtual DOM" vs the "DOM API".
- Just JavaScript, as the author said, React is a small library, it will be your JS skills that's gonna take you furthur.
- Declarative language(model and UI state) - This is the one thing that made React popular.

- In React applications, you don't write HTML, you only write JS. JSX is not HTML.

------------ React basic info ------------
- A component name must start with a capital letter, for example, 'Logger'. If not done this way, React thinks that the provided name is an HTML element.
- Initially in this course, jscomplete.com's playround is used to code. This is the url: https://jscomplete.com/playground
- The good thing about this playground is that both the latest version of React and ReactDOM is preloaded.

------------ First React Hook ------------
- useState() results:
  a) state object(getter) - State object can be of any type you wish it to be, it can be a string, an array, or a number.
  b) updater function(setter)

- useState() returns an array with 2 elements.

- The argument to useState is the initial value for the state object('counter' in our case)

- const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  - This syntax is 'Array Destructuring'

- onClick={functionRef}: onClick attribute is case-sensitive, it has to be 'Camel Cased'. This attribute expects a 'Function Reference'.

- onClick={functionRef()}: Function invocation will not work inside this curly brace, Just pass the function pointer.

- useState() is a hook.
